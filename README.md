# IPSec-Site-to-Site-Tunnel

Project Goal:
Implement a secure network using IPSec(or wireguard,..) protocols to protect data communications
and evaluate its security between 2 different sites (e.g: HQ and branch office).
Execution Steps:
• Implement a secure network using IPSec and TLS for data encryption.
• Evaluate and analyze network resilience against various attacks (e.g., Replay Attacks, Man-inthe-Middle).
• Simulate attacks and monitor their impact on network performance.
• Propose optimization solutions to enhance communication security and overall performance.
